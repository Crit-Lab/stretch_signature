!Series_summary = Infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 may cause a severe disease, termed COVID-19, with significant mortality. Host responses to this infection, mainly in terms of systemic inflammation, have emerged as key pathogenetic mechanisms, and their modulation is the only therapeutic strategy that has shown a mortality benefit. Herein, we used peripheral blood transcriptomes of critically-ill COVID-19 patients obtained at admission in an Intensive Care Unit, to identify two clusters that, in spite of no major clinical differences, have different gene expression profiles that reveal different underlying pathogenetic mechanisms and ultimately have different ICU outcome. A transcriptomic signature was used to identify these clusters in an external validation cohort, yielding a similar result. These results illustrate the potential of transcriptomic profiles to identify patient endotypes and point to relevant pathogenetic mechanisms in COVID-19.

!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library construction and sequencing was externalized to BGI Genomics (Beijin, China)
!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Standard BGI protocol for miRNA sequencing was applied
!Sample_data_processing = Basecalling was performed using the default Illumina software
!Sample_data_processing = trimming was performed using the trim_galore software v0.6.6 and the parameters -length 16
!Sample_data_processing = mapping was performed using the miRDeep2 mapper.pl script (last update 21/04/2016). A bowtie index for hg38 was used.
!Sample_data_processing = known and novel miRNAs were quantified using the miRDeep2.pl script v2.0.1.3. Mature and hairpin human miRNA sequences were downloaded from miRBase. MiRNAs annotated for all primate species were used as reference for the discovery step.
